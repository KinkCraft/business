# Kink Craft Business
We pride ourselves on thinking very differently to everyone else. This is why we are able to bring a unique approach to everything we create. Everything we do should always be fun, colourful, different. From approaching classic ideas with a modern twist to things that have never been done before. We are not afraid to experiment.

### Fun
One of the very first things we decided was we wanted everything we did to be fun and approachable to everyone. From our packaging to our customer service it is all designed to be inviting and inclusive. We want everyone to enjoy every aspect of us, not just like the toys.

### Colourful
When it comes to colour there isn't much choice in the adult industry, we want to change that. There will always be some classic colours that simply go with everything, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for someone to express themselves with bright colourful toys and clothes.

### Quality
Our most important decision was that we will never compromise on quality. We have all had products that we thought were going to be amazing but when we got them we were disappointed with their execution. That isn't who we want to be. From the smallest products to kits. Everything about them shows we not only choose the best materials but pay close attention to the detail.

## Different by design
We have created products that allows you to have a much more interaction with your customers, giving them a reason to come back to you again and again. While also giving them amazing quality toys much cheaper than they could otherwise get them. 

### Kits
The kits give the customer everything they need to make their own toys. When they are done they do look just like the professionally finished products. They follow our videos tutorials and by the end thay have crafted a toy so personal to them they could never let it go. That isn't something you can just buy, and once they have made one they will want to make more. 

### Ready made
Not everyone wants to make things for themselves so all our products can also be bought ready to use. Here we want the customer to have an amazing experience even just by being given the box with our product in. 

## Handmade in the UK
Everything we offer is handmade here in the UK. From the wooden handles we use in our floggers to the latex clothing. All of our products are made in the UK by the most talented people we can find. This not only allows us to give something back to the UK but gives us some of the most skilled crafts men and women available.

## Latex
New for this year is our take on latex clothing. We don't think it should be only for the bedroom, or only for the most skinny people. Latex can be very flattering even on larger people as long as the design is right. This is a growing demographic in the UK and one we feel is much more representative of the people.
